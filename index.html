        <h2>Dictator for Life</h2>
            <p>
                He was one of the greatest leaders of ancient Rome, remembered as a brilliant general, 
                fearless statesman, and skilled orator. He expanded Roman territory through his victories in Gaul 
                and built a reputation for unmatched military genius. His ambition and charisma made him a central 
                figure in Roman politics.
            </p>

            <p>
                He reshaped Rome with bold reforms — from reorganizing the calendar into the Julian system 
                to easing debt, expanding citizenship, and centralizing power. His rise to absolute authority earned 
                him the title <i>Dictator Perpetuo</i> (Dictator for Life), making him both admired and feared. 
                His increasing power, however, alarmed the Senate, leading to his assassination on the Ides of March 
                in 44 BC. In that final moment, he is said to have uttered the famous words: 
                <br><b><i>“Et tu, Brute?”</i></b>
            </p>

            <p>
                His legacy endures as a symbol of power, ambition, and leadership that changed the course of history. 
                His life reminds us of both the glory and risks of absolute authority. One of his most famous declarations, 
                made after a swift victory, was:
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 15px;">
                “Veni, Vidi, Vici” – “I came, I saw, I conquered.”
